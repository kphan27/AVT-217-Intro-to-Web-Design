I am a Vietnamese American who was born and raised in Virginia. I have been creating art since I was a little girl; however, I have been falling on and off the art wagon for the past several years. It was only until this year when I found inspiration to start again and hopefully go to new lengths with my creativity.        <br><br>        I transferred from Northern Virginia Community College last spring and just started my first semester at George Mason University, Fall 2020. I am currently pursing a BA degree in Visual Art & Technology with a concentration in Graphic Design and a (recently) declared minor in Web Design. I donâ€™t have many Graphic Design works as of yet since I've just only started, but once I start my core classes next semester, I will be able to showcase my creative process. For now, my portfolio mainly consists of samples images of my fine art works and a few graphic works.</p>    </div></div><footer><div class="copyright">    <p><small>Site Designed by Kristie Phan<br>Copyright @ Kristie Phan 2020</small></p>    <div class="social-icons">        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kubiomine/" class="fa fa-facebook"></a>        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" class="fa fa-instagram"></a>        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-p-6348531b3/" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>    </div></div></footer></div>    <script src="js/script.js"></script></body></html>

  <p>Hi, my name is Kristie and I am an artist finding her roots. I am a Vietnamese American who was born and raised in Virginia. I have been creating art since I was a little girl; however, I have been falling on and off the art wagon for the past several years. It was only until this year when I found inspiration to start again and hopefully go to new lengths with my creativity.<br>

  I transferred from Northern Virginia Community College last spring and just started my first semester at George Mason University, Fall 2020. I am currently pursuing a BA degree in Visual Art & Technology with a concentration in graphic design and a (recently) declared minor in web design. I donâ€™t have much graphic design works as of yet since I haven't taken my main design coursework, but once I do next semester, I will be able to showcase my creative process. For now, my portfolio consists of sample images of my fine arts and a few design.</p>

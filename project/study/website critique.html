			<p>Katie's portfolio feels soothing and pleasing to the eye at first glance. Her website is very welcoming where her initial greeting inside a nice animating element sets a good impression to her audience shown: "Nice to meet you, TAKE A PEEK INTO MY WORLD". While her color palette is subtle with some muted tones, her simplistic theme matches perfectly that made her website aesthetically standout. She successfully utilized the layout grid in her web design and the buttons are easy to navigate, despite the text being small. Overall, her website features are all well aligned and visually appealing.</p>

			<p>Mark's portfolio is very fun and eye catching by the way he uses his portfolio as his homepage. He displays a grid of works of different media as he successfully used grid when scrolling down the browser window. He shows a wide selection of projects as an art director and shows knowledge of different disciplines. His tabs are neatly organized inside a toggle menu at the top left side of the screen and his website overall is simple and clean.</p>

			Rick's portfolio theme is minimalistic where his home page display a large gallery of his works.

The navigation is located at the left side of the page and all in plain text. Furthermore, his website is simple and his illustrations help emphasis the appeal of his website content.

			Sato's portfolio is personalized as a walkthrough into her art journey. Her navigation tabs follows her website layout as a scrolling feature from top to bottom where clicking the tabs is an optional feature when one can simply scroll down. Her website has a limited color palette in a way that is still simplistic, yet elegant. She uses a few different types of typography in her page where she uses a cursive font, bolded serif fonts, and san-serif fonts that fits well with her style. Her content shows a lot of personality and everything looks consistent.

			Seonnaâ€™s website is successful seen from how she displays high quality works clearly as she includes concise description for each artwork from old to present day. Her website is very minimal and easy to navigate where she shows her overall art on her homepage and under her 'work' tab using an album collection feature. The website design is strictly professional and a bit business-oriented as we see no personal information about her. Her layout has an endless scroll feature on her home page and used only use a san-serif typeface in her website. Otherwise, her website content is straightforward and simple.

			<p>Mark's portfolio is very fun and eye catching by the way he uses his portfolio as his homepage. He displays a grid of works of different media as he successfully follow the web grid layout when scrolling down the browser window. He shows a wide selection of projects as an art director and shows knowledge of different disciplines in his navigation tabs. Moreover, his tabs are neatly organized inside a toggle menu at the top left corner of the screen. Although each tab displays different color schemes, his layout is still consistently the same. All in all, his website is very informative of different fields of work and pretty simple.</p>

			Sato's portfolio is personalized like a walkthrough of her artist career. Her navigation tabs follows along her website layout as a scrolling feature from top to bottom where clicking the tabs is an optional feature when one can simply scroll down. Her website has a limited color palette in a way that is still simplistic, yet elegant. She uses a few different types of typography in her page where she uses a cursive font, bolded serif fonts, and san-serif fonts that fits well with her style. Her content shows a lot of personality and everything looks consistent.

			Seonnaâ€™s website is successful seen from how she displays high quality works clearly as she includes concise description for each artwork from old to present day. Her website is very minimal and easy to navigate where she shows her overall art on her homepage and under her 'work' tab using an album collection feature. The website design is strictly professional and a bit business-oriented as we see no personal information about her. Her layout has an endless scroll feature on her home page and used only use a san-serif typeface in her website. Otherwise, her website content is straightforward and simple.

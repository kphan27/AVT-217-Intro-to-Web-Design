		<h2>Portfolio Website Design Research</h2>
		<article>
		<p>After researching different styles of portfolio designs from the website critique project, I found that using a minimalistic theme is more effective because of how professional and clean it looks for a website design. While simplicity is important, establishing a consistent color hierarchy and palette enhance visual appeal and balance. Implementing white space and the grid system is an important element to organize content from cluttering together. Furthermore, maintaining consistency in typography choice and appeal is also a significant element for readability and building brand.</p>

		<h2>Design Objective</h2>
		<article>
		<p>My objective is to showcase artworks I've done within the last 2 years of both graphic design and portfolio pieces. I want to set a good visual impression through my art and create a website that represents me. How I am going to achieve this is to keep my site simple yet authentic. I will use grid to align my content together, maintain consistency, and create mockup designs to see which idea would work best in my ability to code and anchor my content together.</p>
